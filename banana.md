# Bananas

## Introduction

Bananas are one of the world's most popular and widely consumed fruits, known for their distinctive curved shape, sweet flavor, and convenient natural packaging. Originating from Southeast Asia and the South Pacific over 7,000 years ago, bananas are now grown in more than 150 countries across tropical and subtropical regions. With global production exceeding 100 million metric tons annually, bananas rank among the top five most valuable food crops worldwide and serve as a staple food for millions of people.

## Varieties

### Cavendish
The most common commercial variety, accounting for nearly 50% of global banana production. Cavendish bananas are known for their bright yellow skin when ripe, creamy texture, and sweet flavor. They are seedless and have a long shelf life, making them ideal for international export.

### Lady Finger
Also known as baby bananas or finger bananas, these are smaller and sweeter than Cavendish varieties. Lady Finger bananas have a creamy texture and a honey-like sweetness with hints of vanilla. They are typically 3-4 inches long and are popular in Australia and Latin America.

### Red Banana
Distinguished by their reddish-purple skin, red bananas are shorter and plumper than Cavendish varieties. They have a sweet, creamy flesh with hints of raspberry flavor. When fully ripe, the skin turns deep maroon and the flesh becomes light pink.

### Plantain
A starchy cooking banana that is larger and less sweet than dessert bananas. Plantains are typically cooked before consumption and are a dietary staple in many tropical regions. They can be eaten at various stages of ripeness, from green (starchy) to black (sweet), and are often fried, boiled, or baked.
