# Apple

Apples are one of the most popular and widely cultivated fruits in the world, belonging to the species *Malus domestica*. Known for their crisp texture, sweet-tart flavor, and versatility, apples have been cultivated for thousands of years and remain a staple in diets across the globe.

## Popular Varieties

### Fuji
Originating from Japan in the 1930s, Fuji apples are known for their exceptional sweetness and crisp texture. They have a dense flesh that stays fresh longer than many other varieties, making them excellent for both eating fresh and storage.

### Gala
Gala apples are a New Zealand variety that has become one of the world's most popular apples. They feature a mild, sweet flavor with hints of vanilla and a thin skin with yellow-orange coloring and red striping. Perfect for snacking and salads.

### Granny Smith
Instantly recognizable by their bright green color, Granny Smith apples originated in Australia in the 1860s. They offer a distinctly tart flavor and firm texture, making them ideal for baking, cooking, and providing a refreshing contrast in fruit salads.

### Honeycrisp
Developed at the University of Minnesota in the 1960s, Honeycrisp apples revolutionized the apple industry with their explosively crisp texture and balanced sweet-tart flavor. Their large cells create a unique juicy crunch that has made them a premium favorite.

### Red Delicious
Once the most popular apple in America, Red Delicious apples are characterized by their deep red color and distinctive elongated shape with five bumps on the bottom. They have a mild, sweet flavor and are best enjoyed fresh rather than cooked.

The old saying "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" has scientific merit, as regular consumption contributes to overall wellness.

## Storage Tips

Proper storage extends the life and quality of apples:

- **Refrigeration**: Store apples in the crisper drawer at 30-35°F (-1 to 2°C)
- **Humidity**: Keep in a perforated plastic bag to maintain moisture while allowing air circulation
- **Separation**: Store away from other produce, as apples emit ethylene gas that accelerates ripening
- **Room temperature**: Apples ripen 10 times faster at room temperature; only keep out what you'll eat within a week
- **Shelf life**: Properly refrigerated apples can last 1-2 months or longer
- **Freezing**: Peel, core, and slice apples, then freeze for use in cooking and baking

Check apples regularly and remove any that show signs of decay to prevent spoilage from spreading.
